But often we just lose our interest in this because of boring and complicated statistic terms. Yes, probability and statistics are boring, but today I want to change your attitude to this and show a little bit more convenient way to learn all the important concepts. When we are playing with a big amount of data where every second is important we have to use some formulas to get things done in minutes if we solve it without using maths it may take an year or more to solve the problem\n \n \n# Introduction\n In this Notebook we will learn about some really simple and awful probability and statistics techniques.

In some cases we have to find alot of combinations.\n\n\n# Real time Example\nI am going to share a real time example that I have been gone through.\n\nI am working as data-scientist in programmers force. Now our goal is to make image clear enough to read text from the image for that we have to apply a list of filters to get our work done. We were working on real time and you know that every image is different from other because some images are capture with dslr some with varity of mobile cams now if we apply every filter on the image some images are crystal clear but some becomes so bad and if we are playing with images order of filters do matter e.g if we apply erision filter on image and than apply dillation filter on the image their will be no effect on the image so this combination is so bad. and if we apply erision filter and than apply remove_small_dots filter on the image this combination gives really satisfying results. Now we have to find combination of filters that we will apply on every image and predict it from our model and keep on apply filter until the model confidence becomes greater than 95 percent. We have total of 12 filters and in 1 request we have to process approximate 12 images. for every request our alogrithm is taking 100ms to process 1 combination on 1 image. Now we have total of **12!(479001600) combination** and **12 images**. So total we have **5748019200 combination to process 1 request**  approximatly 18 years to process 1 request. Damn if we go into the coding without knowing about the figures we lost our 1 to 2 weeks that will be totaly useless.
